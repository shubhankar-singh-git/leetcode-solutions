We need to find the second highest distinct digit present in a string.

Only characters '0' to '9' matter.

Digits range → 0 to 9.

If we always know:

the largest digit so far.

the second largest digit so far.

then we can solve the problem in one pass.

So, we just track two values while scanning the string.
